### About

frmwrk builds products at the intersection of design and technology.  
We focus on creating systems that are clear, functional, and built to last.

Current projects include:
- **Playtester** — a discovery platform for upcoming and ongoing game playtests

Each product reflects frmwrk’s core principles: precision, usability, and thoughtful execution.

### Philosophy

We believe in building products that balance form and function.  
Good design is invisible. Good technology stays out of the way.  
frmwrk exists to create what happens when both align.
